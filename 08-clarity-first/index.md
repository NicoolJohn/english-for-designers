# NaPong – new drinking game
---
## Summary

NaPong is add-on card game to existing drinking game Beerpong. My thesis focuses on game concept, design and advertisement – mainly on social media. My goal is to create fully-functioning and intuitive game to enrich gameplay of one of the most played college games in the US, and to bring it to Czechia with the intent of selling the product myself.

## Key Points

<!-- Key points; aim for **30–60 words** each. -->

1. Background/importance of topic: My main reason for the topic of my thesis was my already existing expirience with board games, as it is something I am interested in. Czech and Slovakian market is missing these kinds of games, as already proven by high demand for my already existing card game. Hopefully the project will extend those markets in drinking games, while also monetizing the idea. 
2. Purpose/hypothesis (thesis or statement of problem): I want to reach out of my comfort zone and step up my game in creating games. My project should not only fill the market, but also be sort of a guide on how to create such game from creating the concept of the game to advertisement. It should also give an insight on what work is needed to bring it to life. 
3. Research — design/methodology/approach including procedures/data/observations: First of all I will be doing the research of current market, however there are not a lot of similar games in Czech and neither in foreign countries, so the main source of information will be survey. I will be getting ingo from several social groups, but my main source of data will be already existing group of followers I gained thanks to the game NaKáry. They are also my main targeted audience, as they expressed interest in similar games before.
4. Findings (highlight outcome of research):
5. Conclusions (significance/success of study to theory/practical/society): As I said, I hope to finish the whole concept of the game as well as the game itself and be able to sell it as a sister product to my already existing game, and bring hours of fun to czech and slovak people.
