# Review

1. What did you like most about this subject?
Probably the laid back concept of the lessons and the creative freedom regarding all of the projects. This safe space was created, where I knew that even though I didn´t do the work I was supposed to do on time, I could come and not be much stressed about it.

2. What did you like least about this subject?
3 hours was really long time, I sometimes struggled to stay focused. Even though I know it´s not something that can be influenced, I would much rather have 2 lessons that each last hour and a half.

3. What were the top 3 things you learned this year?
    I learned some cool sites, like Hemingway
    Good writing takes time
    

4. What was the most memorable activity/assignment from this year?
    Probably Storytelling presentations, I really enjoyed it and I personaly did something new which I would normally never thought of doing.

5. What is something you accomplished this year that you are proud of?
    Got orginised (sort of?) in GitHub and it is really cool to look back on all of the stuff we did, so all of it.

6. What is one thing you learned about yourself this year?
    I feel way better when I start project actually on time and not the night before.

7. What is one thing you would add or change about this class?
    Not much, apart from the 3 hours. 

8. What is one thing you could have done better this year?
    Attendence, and also try to stay more focused.

9. What is one thing I could have done better as a teacher this year?
    Nothing, it was cool and personal :) Sometimes the lessons did not feel like lesson at all, but rather catch-up talk.

10. What advice would you give to students going into this subject next year?
    If you at least try, there are so many cool things you can do even if you don´t know it yet!
